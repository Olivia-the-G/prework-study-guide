        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represenets the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>li = list item</li>
          <li>ul = unordered  list</li>
          <li>ol = ordered list</li>
          <li>h1 - 6 tell the computer what size of header the text is</li>
          <li>The "section" element is how you separate different elements. See "parent/child elements".</li>
          <li>Parent elements are the larger elements that contain the child elements eg. section = parent, h2 = child.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>For your CSS code to affect your project, you need to link it to your other files.</li>
            <li>A class selector allows you to give property assigments to only some elements instead of all of them.</li>
            <li>Here's some examples of properties you can change: text-allign, padding-left/right/top/bottom, margin, width, height, color, background-color, font-size, border, etc.</li>

            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
            <li>The git flow is the order you perform the steps of uploading your work to github.</li>
            <li>The git flow goes like this...</li>
              <ol>
                <li>In the terminal, make sure you are in the correct directory and branch, and run the command 'git add -A' to stage your changes</li>
                <li>Add a commit message that describes the changes made to the code using the command 'git commit -m "your message here"'</li>
                <li>Make sure your local branch is up to date by running 'git pull origin main'</li>
                <li>Push up your changes to the remote repo by running 'git push origin (your current feature branch)'</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
          <h2>Javascript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in your code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>The control flow affects how your code needs to be written. In order to use a variable in a function or otherwise, the variable needs to be defined first. Order matters!</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable used to hold a group of data.</li>
            <li>You can access the data inside an array by using the index value of the item we want.</li>
            <li>A for loop allows you to repeat a single block of code over and over on each item in an array.</li>
            <li>For loop structure = Starting point; Condition; Final statement. </li>
              <ol>
                <li>Starting point: The first index of an array is always 0, so we declare a variable x and assign it a value of zero. </li>
                <li>Condition: Using the length propery we can express that we want the loop to continue as long as the variable x is less than the length of the array.</li>
                <li>Final Statement: This is what we are telling the loop to do each time. We can use x++ to increase the number by 1 each time the loop repeats.</li>
                <li>eg. for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) { // code block}</li>
              </ol>
            <li>Functions need to be followed by parenthases ()</li>
